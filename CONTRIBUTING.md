1. **Fidelity to Dune Lore:**  
   Ensure your scene resonates with the themes, tone, and aesthetic of the Dune universe.

2. **Script Length:**  
   Contribute short segments (30-60 seconds) to maintain flexibility.

3. **Use of Sora Prompts:**  
   Reference existing prompts in `prompts/` or add your own. Include these prompts in your scene file.

4. **File Naming:**  
   Add your new scene in `scripts/scene_contributions` with a unique file name like `scene_01_yourName.md`.

5. **Pull Requests:**  
   Submit a PR explaining what youâ€™ve added, how it fits into the narrative, and which prompts you used.

6. **Respectful Collaboration:**  
   Be respectful and considerate. Follow canonical Dune references as best as possible. Constructive feedback is welcome.

By following these guidelines, we ensure a rich, evolving narrative tapestry for everyone to enjoy.
